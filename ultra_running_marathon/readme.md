## Project Overview

This project analyzes ultra marathon races in the U.S., focusing on 50km and 50Mi races from 2020. The dataset used is TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES.csv, and the analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights on race trends.

**Usage**

Load the dataset and clean it to filter only U.S. races.
Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using pandas and visualization libraries.
Generate insights on ultra marathon running trends.

**Dataset used**:

TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES.csv contains ultra marathon race records from multiple years, focusing on U.S. races (50km & 50Mi) from 2020.

## Features
